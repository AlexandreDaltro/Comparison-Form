This is my first project using Javascript. A Form that uses Javacript Vanilla and CSS to compare investments, and forecast which one is the best option.
I`ve made it, to help clients to understand better in which Product Photographer to invest, based on prices, profit return expectation, and time.

It calculates profit raise, percentage raise, revenues and profit forecast over a period of time.

I created form validation (For Blank, Zero and Negative values (Including in the results)), using Javacript together with CSS to highlight the needed fields, and also to show the right error messages.

At the end of the calculation, it highlights in green the best option, and in red the other one.
